               <h2>Transport</h2>

              <p>
            The most popular way to get around Nairobi is by use of public transport systems.
             Available modes of transport include buses, trains, boda bodas (motorcycles) ,
              taxis and tuk tuks. The use of matatus is currently the most widely
              used means to get around Nairobi.. They are easily recognizable
              by the yellow stripe painted on their sides. They usually stand because they are painted over with great designs and some offer additional services such as free wifi. Within Nairobi it will be rare to exceed 100shillings , ( 1 dollar)  in a single commute. You have not experienced Nairobi until you have ridden in a matatu!

     <h2>Security</h2>

    <p>
    Being in a new place can be scary and with all the travel
     bans and warnings that Nairobi has received in the past it
      is only natural that many of you would be wary of moving
      around.  We highly advise that you register with your
       embassy as soon as you arrive. If there is any major
       incident, the consulate will know you may need their
        help or can at least contact your loved ones back home.
         In case you find yourself in an emergency situation,
          the general emergency number is 999.
          If you are involved in an accident, call the police
           immediately and wait until they arrive.  Additionally,
            make sure you also know the number of your nearest
            police station. Should you fall sick, there are plenty
            of hospitals and clinics around Nairobi, including flying doctor services
            to assist you.
