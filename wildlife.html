               <h2>The Drive in the National Park</h2>

              <p>I n the heart of Nairobi stands Nairobi National Park, the only national park on earth that borders a capital city. If you do not have much time to go to other national parks, this is worth a visit. You get to see most of the animals that you would on a regular safari.

              It is important to hire a driver who is familiar with the game park, routes and sites as he or she would know where the animals are. One can see many animals and get some excellent photos.

              Arriving early at about 6:00am is recommended. You will get to see the sunrise. There is also a higher probability of seeing many more animals. Animals reported to have been seen include, monkeys, giraffes, hippos, buffalo, rhinos, zebra's, antelopes, and many other animals including lions if you are lucky.
              Entrance fee is $ 50 and $ 25 for children
              It is located 14 km away from the Central Business District which is around 30 minutes depending on traffic

      <h2>Snake Park</h2>
      <p>
    The Nairobi Snake Park was started in January, 1961 to meet a popular attraction and to provide a research facility on reptiles, breeding of snakes. Live snakes were exhibited on experimental basis at the entrance of the Museum in 1958 which later became a popular attraction.When the popularity was noted, a portion of land in front of the Museum and down to the Nairobi River was acquired by the Museum Trustees for the development of Botanical gardens and exhibitions on live snakes.


    It is also offering services such as rescue and rehabilitation centre for reptiles
     (abandoned, confiscated, illegal collection),
     dissemination of information on aquarium fishes and reptiles as well as specialized talks on the same.
    Located at a serene environment with a spacious compound, the Snake Park is an ideal place for relaxation by our visitors to enjoy the cool breeze.
